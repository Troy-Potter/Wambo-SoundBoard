# Android Studio Project from Vermont Tech 

This project was an android soundboard app created in Android Studio. This soundboard had some sounds pre-installed and allowed 
users to add their own sounds. To add a sound a user could either record one or upload a sound file. These sounds could also be deleted 
allowing other sounds to fill their place.
